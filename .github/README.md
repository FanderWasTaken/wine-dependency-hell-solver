# Wine Dependency Hell Solver üç∑

![logo](WDHS.png)

## Description

If you ever had issues with software in Wine, then try this script. I made it as an alternative for Wine/Proton-tricks, so you can spend more time using the software you want and less time tinkering. The main goal of this project is to provide users with dependencies similar to Valve's installscript.vdf.

*Please note that not every game or program can be fixed by this script, but it should help in most cases.*

## Additional configuration

Here are some of the best practices to follow in order to minimize potential issues when running software with Wine:

* [Increase <code>swap</code> size](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap)
* [Increase the value of <code>vm.max\_map\_count</code>](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Gaming#Increase_vm.max_map_count)
* [Load shared objects immediately](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Gaming#Load_shared_objects_immediately_for_better_first_time_latency)
