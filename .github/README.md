# Wine Dependency Hell Solver üç∑

![logo](WDHS.png)

## Description

If you ever had issues with software in Wine, then try this script. I made it as an alternative for Wine/Proton-tricks, so you can spend more time using the software you want and less time tinkering. The main goal of this project is to provide users with dependencies similar to Valve's installscript.vdf.
