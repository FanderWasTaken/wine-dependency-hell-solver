# Wine Dependency Hell Solver

![logo](WDHS.png)

## Introduction

If you ever had issues launching or running software with Wine or on Windows, then try this script I made, it should solve most issues you may encounter.

## Description

This is a script that functions similarly to how Valve's installscript.vdf does. It installs dependencies for games to work properly. However, not every game comes with all the required dependencies. So I decided to write a universal script to install **every single dependency** any game may require to work.

## Examples

Here are games that were fixed partially or completely after running this script:

- [Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/1831) - Issues with sound and video playback
- [Darksiders](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/264) - Missing main menu, in-game UI and cut-scenes
- [Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/1185) - Broken character select screen
- [Tell Me Why](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6829) - Cut-scenes crashes
- [The Darkness II](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/563) - Missing voice over
- [Ultra Street Fighter IV](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/345) - Missing videos
- [Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6795) - Broken cut-scenes

**Linux Disclaimer**: Though my script installs Media Foundation you may still exhibit unwanted behavior with Wine. Use builds by [Thomas Crider, e.g. GloriousEggroll](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll) in case of any issues.

## General tips

### Linux üêß

<details><summary> Display settings</summary>

Wayland/Gamescope help to alleviate most issues related to screen-tearing, frame pacing and input latency. If you're experiencing screen-tearing or bad frame pacing, e.g. lag, on X11, please follow [this guide](https://linuxreviews.org/HOWTO_fix_screen_tearing).

</details>

<details><summary> Shader cache and DXVK related stuttering</summary>

In order to minimize stuttering with Wine on Mesa below version 23.1, use [dxvk-async](https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async).

**Mesa 23.1 made GPL the default way of working with shaders. That means that there would be a severe reduction in stutters one could encounter while using DXVK for games. There is no need to use patched DXVK versions if you have newer Mesa.**

### Windows ü™ü

<details><summary>System setup, updates and drivers</summary>

Make sure to run `dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth` in a Terminal or PowerShell as Administrator. This will fix any issues you have with your Windows install.

Don't change things that you don't fully understand the use of or don't know how to recover from these changes.

Install latest drivers from [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support), [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) or [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/search.html#sort=relevancy&f:@tabfilter=[Downloads]&f:@stm_10385_en=[Graphics]) for your hardware, non-beta releases are recommended.
