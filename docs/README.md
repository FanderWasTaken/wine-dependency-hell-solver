# Wine Dependency Hell Solver

![logo](WDHS.png)

Ever had issues launching or running Windows games under Wine? If the answer is "Yes", then try these scripts I made; they should solve most issues you may encounter. And in case my script did make your gaming experience worse, then feel free to create an issue here on GitHub so I can help you out.

*Although I made these scripts primarily for games, this can help application compatibility as well. Adobe apps use some DirectX for rendering, and some programs are written using .NET. So feel free to try it out in that use case as well.*

Feel free to donate if you like my work or if I was of any help to you on your gaming journey!

## What is this exactly?
This is a collection of scripts that function similarly to how Valve's installscript.vdf does. The said .vdf file installs Windows dependencies upon first launch for games to work properly. However, this is not always the case. Not all Steam games come with all the required dependencies installed. Also, non-Steam and older games don't always come with these either. So I decided to write a universal script to install **every single dependency** any game may require to work. This usually fixes startup problems, issues related to videos not playing, missing audio, and broken UI or menus. These scripts should work with any Wine version and prefix manager, including Steam.

## What's being installed:
- [DirectX End-User Runtimes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)
- [ASP.NET Core Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Media](https://github.com/z0z0z/mf-installcab) [Foundation](https://github.com/z0z0z/mf-install)
- [NVIDIA PhysX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/physx/9_09_0428/physx_9-09-0428_whql/)
- [Visual C++ Redistributable packages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)

**Disclaimer**: Though my script installs Media Foundation dependencies you may still exhibit unwanted behavior.

**All installers are taken directly from official sources.**

## How to use:

Make sure that you have `curl` and `7z` installed on your system before proceeding.

1. Download and extract the latest release.
2. Open your terminal in the extracted folder.
3. Make `.sh` executable by running `chmod +x ./installers/Download_installers.sh`.
4. Run `./installers/Download_installers.sh` in your terminal. This will download  all the required installation files.
5. Run `WDHS.bat` with Wine or Proton inside the game's prefix; the script will inform you when it's done.

Steps 1-4 are only for people running this for the first time. You can keep downloaded installers and `WDHS.bat` somewhere in your home directory to re-use later if needed.

## Additional tips for a better gaming experience

[Protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) can be used to execute `WDHS.bat` with a double click and applied to any Steam game you have installed.

If you are using [Lutris](https://lutris.net/), go into `Preferences`, `Global Options` for **Wine runner** and make sure to have `Disable Lutris Runtime` and `Prefer system libraries` enabled (switched on).

Also, I personally recommend you install `gamescope` package from your distribution and use it with games. [Gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) can fix screen-tearing and lower overall input latency during gameplay. It can be enabled via [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)' `Preferences`, `System Options` menus. For Steam games, add `gamescope -f -e -h [your screen resolution, e.g. 1080] -r [optional framerate cap, e.g. 60] -- %command%` as a launch option.

Windows uses virtual memory in weird ways. The default Linux limit on virtual memory is likely to be too low, which may result in game crashes. You can increase virtual memory permanently. Update the `vm.max_map_count=262144` setting in `/etc/sysctl.conf`. To verify after rebooting, run `sysctl vm.max_map_count`.

If you're using an integrated GPU, e.g. Vega of Intel, go into your BIOS and set a fixed amount of memory allocated towards your GPU, don't leave that setting on Auto as it will cause more "Out of Memory" errors. And if you have both discreet and integrated GPUs then make sure that your BIOS' preferences are set to prioritize PCI-E GPU over the integrated one.

If you wish to import your [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) games to Steam with the least amount of headaches, use [Steam ROM Manager](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager). Despite its name, SRM can import data from `.desktop` application shortcut. How does it differ from importing games directly from Lutris? It allows you to add custom artwork for games, sourced from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/). Create a new Parser and use `Non Steam Shortcuts` as a template. Add `*/${title}@(.desktop|.DESKTOP)` as `User's glob` parameter and lead `ROMs directory` to the path you have your games installed. Create a desktop shortcut for your game from Lutris and place `.desktop` shortcut into your game's directory. Save, go to `Preview` and press `Parse`.

[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) can cause stuttering while playing a game for the first time, which ruins the experience. In order to minimize the amount of stuttering, run `sudo nano /etc/profile.d/gpl.sh` add this line: `RADV_PERFTEST=gpl`. Press `CTRL+O` to save changes and `CTRL+X` to exit. Reboot to apply the changes.

## Troubleshooting
Before opening an issue, make sure to try different [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) versions with your game. The recommended path is to go from the newest release down to the oldest. Personally, I found that Proton 7 had fewer compatibility issues than Proton 8.
